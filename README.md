### Requirements

All Python dependencies that are used by this package are installed when installing pygor via the pip command. However, some software needs to installed manually when planning on using specific functionalities within pygor:

| Function | Requirement |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Creating CDR3 anchors (`cdr3_container.py`) | This requires [MUSCLE](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/) to be installed on the computer. For macOS users, muscle can also be install via HomeBrew by tapping into `brewsci/bio` and installing MUSCLE via `brew install muscle` |
